### Hi! I'm Mitchell.
* I'm a full stack dev. Web and mobile apps are where I shine.
* I presently work at [ISE](https://ise.io). Most notably on [Start VRM](https://startvrm.com), a third party risk management tool.

Please check out my projects! Some fun ones:
* [__quiki__](https://github.com/cooper/quiki) - a file-based wiki server with admin panel, supports markdown and a custom markup, written in Go.
* [__juno__](https://github.com/cooper/juno) - a feature complete, hot reloadable IRC server written in Perl with modern extensions.
* [__ferret__](https://github.com/cooper/ferret) - a very high level programming language I invented for fun.
